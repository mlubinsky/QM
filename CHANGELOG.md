## [Unreleased]

### Added (2026-03-29)

**Plot improvements** (`frontend/src/components/MainPlot.tsx`, `SecondaryPlot.tsx`)
- Clip V(x) in the main plot so infinite/large potential walls no longer compress the wavefunction traces. Ceiling is computed as `E_max + 50%·|E_max| + 1` (stationary) or the 90th-percentile of V values (time-evolution).
- Add thin dashed horizontal lines at each energy level in the main stationary plot, showing the baseline each eigenfunction is offset from.
- Add V(x) as a light filled background trace in the secondary energy-levels plot, producing the classic energy-level-diagram appearance.

**UI controls** (`frontend/src/components/ControlPanel.tsx`, `App.tsx`, `App.css`)
- Display the current numeric value next to each range slider: `n_points`, `n_states`, `n_steps`.
- Solve/Run button now changes color to communicate solver state:
  - **Green** — parameters not yet submitted (initial state).
  - **Amber** — parameters have changed since the last successful solve; a re-run is needed.
  - **Gray** — displayed results are up to date with current parameters.
- Changed `ControlPanel` prop from `loading: boolean` to `status: AppStatus` so the component can distinguish idle / loading / success / error states.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-28

### Added

- Initial release: FastAPI backend with Crank-Nicolson time evolution and eigenstate solver; React + TypeScript frontend with Plotly-based plots, animation controls, CSV/JSON export, and URL-state persistence.
